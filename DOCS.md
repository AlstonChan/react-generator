## Package execution with `npx` return error in Windows

This is primarily due to the missing of **shebang line**, read [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33509816/what-exactly-does-usr-bin-env-node-do-at-the-beginning-of-node-files) for more information.

To solve this, include `#!/usr/bin/env node` in the top of the entry file and the problem will be fixed. Also, `bin` property have to be added to `package.json`. Check out this [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25333570/npm-package-json-bin-wont-work-on-windows) for more info.

## The generated cmd has syntax error and returns error when executed

When executing the package with `npx`, it will return the following error:

```text
The input line is too long.
The syntax of the command is incorrect.
```

When inspecting the `cmd` file located in the bin directory generated by npm, the last line of the file will contain a incredible long line of word, which explains the error occurrences. This would happen simply because the package *(@vercel/ncc)* that is responsible to bundle this generator mixed the **shebang line** with the compiled code.

To fix this error, simply add a **newline character ('\n')** after the **shebang line**, this split the shebang line from the generated code.
In our case, `helper/shebang-add-newline/shebang.ts` is created to automatically add a newline after the code is compiled, so I don't have to do it manually.
